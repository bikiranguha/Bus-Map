34 kV mapping:

	First, make sure all the 34 kV buses in the planning case are connected to step up transformers only. If they have other 34 kV branches, print them
	Get all the 34 kV buses which are connected to transformers. If the 34 kV buses are not connected to other 34 kV buses, leave them as is.
	If the 34 kV buses are part of a 34 kV network, then we need to figure out a way to deal with them:
		Make groups of 34 kV buses, and identify the end points
		 If the end points are not connected to other transformers, then we map the entire way with the same bus angle as the starting points
		 If the end points are connected to other tf, we try to map all angle in the mid-nodes according to the line impedance.
