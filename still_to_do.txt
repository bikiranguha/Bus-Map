Logs:
	ThreetoTwoWinderManualMapv2.txt contains the new maps of the CAPE three winders, for cases where a CAPE three winder is actually a two winder in planning. By new maps, i mean that the maps have been generated from manual_map file.
	It has been generated from threetoTwoWinderAuto.txt and using changeThreeToTwoWinderTFMappingv4.py
	
	ThreetoTwoWinderNewIsssues.txt lists the new issues. Any bus which has no map has been labeled as 0.
	threetoTwoWinderDuplIssue.txt contains all the cases where multiple CAPE 3w tf are being mapped to a single 2w tf in planning.  This issue file should be compared with ThreetoTwoWinderManualMap.txt and ThreetoTwoWinderNewIsssues.txt
	noconnection3wIssuesSolved.txt contains the solution strategy for all the cases where a CAPE 3w did not have a proper connection between primary and secondary in planning
	For CAPE tf which were deemed by the script to have no corresponding planning tf (len of planning bus map == 1), they have been left as is in the new tf file. Any phase shift has been incorporated in the bus data file.
	4winderlog.txt lists all the old and new 4 winder tf data
	4winderSubSummary.txt summarizes the process of generating the new transformers from the 4 winder data
	deleteOld4winderdata.txt lists all the transformers to be deleted from the CAPE raw file
	new4winderdata.txt lists all the tf data to be added (from the fixed 4 winder data)
	AdvancedMidPointCases.txt includes all the CAPE cases which are mapped to midpoint sets in planning (found manually)
	substitute3wTo2w.py does all the 3w->2w impedance transfer. Note that it acts on  a raw file where the three winders have already been converted. It also handles CZ = 2 and CZ = 3 cases.
	Fix3wto3wAndNoChangeCasesInFinalSol.py solves all the cases where 3 winders are left as is, and  3 winders have 3 winder substitution
	newTFDataToSubstitute.txt contains the most recent substitution of 4 winder impedance, to be added into the raw file which contains only 2 winders
	TFToSkip.txt contains all the 2 winders to skip adding in the raw file which contains only 2 winders
	In the folder 'Raw with only 2 winders':
		addtfSpecialCases.py removes the previous tf data corresponding to 4 winder tf needed changing, and adds the updated tf data. It also runs substitute3wTo2w.py and gets the tf data to add into the final
		raw file.
		
	
	
Solve issue:

	#Make sure to fix the manual issues first, that of missing tf, multiple tf connected to a tf tertiary bus.
	#Implement the strategies detalied in missingTFStrategy_ManualTFMapping.txt
	Find a strategy to properly map the angles of taps in the 345 system. Look at the cases causing mismatch and try to find a pattern.
	See if you can use the names of the buses to automate some of the mapping.
	#Look at Manual_Mapping0501 and make Manual_Mapping0503 which does not include any mapping where the LV bus is a generator bus
	Make sure these changes are still there after accomodating any new changes:
	271069,274151,1->2027,400090,1
	272115,274226,8-> 1919,400177,1

	#Generate a text file which contains all the issue cases (non-existent tf or duplicate mapping). In tryNumericTFMapping, skip these mappings and generate the new raw file.
	Investigate the tertiaries containing loads
	Examine why 273341,273340,'3 ','WASHI TR 73 ' does not have an equivalent in CAPE. Details in case_WashingtonPark.txt
	TF 271788,274256,     0,'7 ,'JO409 77    ' has no equivalent tf in CAPE. What to do with it
	Investigate why Bus 5418 is connected to two midpoints and why Bus 275174 is connected to so many tf
	Implement the comments in dealwithTFTer.py
	#Generate LAMP reports for every bus in CAPE Comed and sort them in descending order of mismatch
	#Generate a list of transformer tertiaries. Their bus names should end with 'TER'. Make sure they dont have any loads on them. Map them to their HV bus, so that there is no power flow to them
	#Do something about buses such as Bus 5402,'TONNET78 TER'. This bus angle was far off due to wrong mapping. Using regex, you can get a list of such mapping and 
	#map them to neighbouring HV bus (or even 34 kV bus)
	#In tryNumericTFMatching:
		#Look at all the planning tf set in testMapOld. Add them to the planningMappedTFSet
		#In all the functions, add functionality to skip adding map log and map lines if the newly found tf map already existed in testMapOld
	#Once you get the mapping file from the CS guys, please check the following mappings:

	#Update loadMap.py so that if the LV CAPE bus has no load, it ignores the bus which has the load in the loadBusNoChange.log
	#Look at the PSSE log files for the new raw and figure out the angle issues
	Add to mapping_priority1.txt all the manual maps done so far. This file should be consulted first by any script which is going to map something (bus, tf, loads, shunts)
	#In the loadNoChange log file, see in which cases a LV load bus in CAPE has been mapped to a HV bus in planning. This needs to be fixed. After fix, tryNumericTFMapping can be re-applied to get better results.

	#Generate a script which will do the mapping of the buses, loads and transformers given a right combo
	#Maybe most of the CAPE LV mult tf loads with 4 digits and starting with 4 all end with numbers which signify the tf no. This can help automate some of the mappings
